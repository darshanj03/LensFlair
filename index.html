        <h2>How Does a Camera Work?</h2>
        <p class="art-text">Everyday, 1.8 billion photographs are shared on the web, pausing life and turning moments
          into digital pixels of information.</p>

        <h2>Lighting</h2>
        <p class="art-text">Even the most expensive camera is
          worthless inside a completely dark
          room. We've come a long way from
          the first room-sized cameras, the
          essence of photography has remained
          the same: light. Whether you are
          shooting film or digital, you cannot
          shoot anything without light.</p>

        <h2>Post Processing</h2>
        <p class="art-text">Opening Photoshop for the first time is like cracking open a fantasy novel that opens up an
          entirely new world of strange creatures, opposite natural laws and a completely new language. That new fantasy
          world is bursting with exciting possibilities, yet bogged down by so many unknowns.</p>

        <h2>Exposure Traingle</h2>
        <p class="art-text">For many starting out in photography, the relationship between aperture, shutter speed, and
          ISO can be confusing. To further muddy the water, the terms ‘stop’ and ‘f-stop’ are often used interchangeably
          but refer to different things. In this article, we would like to take some of the mystery out of these
          concepts by talking about the exposure triangle and why it is important to understand for those who are
          starting out. </p>

        <h2>Exposure</h2>
        <p class="art-text">One of the hardest things to perfect in a photo is the exposure, as there are many pieces to
          bring together for the perfect image. Exposure bracketing allows you to take 3 images at 3 different exposures
          which gives you the security of knowing that one of them will have captured the light in the best possible
          way.</p>

        <h2>Aperture</h2>
        <p class="art-text">Beginner photographers are often intimidated by the term exposure triangle, and think that
          they missed a lesson in geometry class. But the 3 components of this triangle - aperture, ISO and shutter
          speed - are key when learning about the technique and composition of an image.</p>

        <img src="assets/images/shutter-speed.jpg" id="article-img">
        <h2>Shutter Speed</h2>
        <p class="art-text">That characteristic sound that a camera takes as it snaps a photo? That’s the camera’s
          shutter. And while the shutter may move the same way every time you take a photograph, it doesn’t always move
          at the same speed.</p>

        <h2>ISO</h2>
        <p class="art-text">ISO is one of the three pillars of photography (the other two being shutter speed and
          aperture), and it has a major effect on your images. How does camera ISO affect your images? In this article,
          we will introduce ISO for beginners and explain how to use it effectively for the best possible results.</p>

        <p class="art-text">Photography captures a moment in time — but who says that moment has to be a split second?
          Long exposure photography takes a single image over several seconds or even several minutes.</p>

        <p class="art-text">Is it a great subject? An expensive camera? High-end DSLRs have taken some crappy photos.
          Toy cameras have taken breathtaking shots. And amazing images have featured things as simple as a glass of
          water.</p>
